# LanguCards

Are you a language learner? Need a better way to store your vocabulary than merely "term: definition"? LanguCards is here for you!

## Link to app: [LanguCards](https://langucardsapp.web.app/)

With LanguCards you may study several languages. In your Learning Box, open as many language Packets as you'd like. You can conveniently work with right-to-left and left-to-right language, no worries.

## LanguCard

What makes LanguCards special is your ability to say more about each vocabulary term you want to log. You can choose its part-of-speech, an example sentence, the dialect it's used in, and more - all of these are optional of course.

You may choose how well you memorize the term and whether or not it needs revision (in case you logged it in a hurry or want to just reassure yourself in the future).

Go through all of your LanguCards quickly using the arrows on the bottom right to study the terms.

You may for example (shown on the right below) look up all the South American words that you marked as 1 and 2 in terms of memorization - meaning the South American words you don't remember well and need to study and subsequently mark them at a 3 or 4 memorization when they solidify in your mind.
